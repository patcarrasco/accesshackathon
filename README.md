# SafeList

SafeList is an application that allows users to keep track of sexual partners in between consecutive STD tests. We are going to reduce the incidence and spread of STDs & STIs by removing a powerful barrier partners have in communicating with each other: awkwardness. Users of SafeList will keep track of the partners they've been with and use cutting-edge blockchain technology to track and control the spread of STDs & STIs.

## Prerequisites

Users must register with Blockstack.js. In order to do so, visit: https://browser.blockstack.org/.
Once registered, users will be able to log into SafeList and interact with other users on our network.

## How to Use SafeList

Using SafeList is simple. After each hook up, find your partner on SafeList's network, and add them to your list of partners. (Remember, no one can see your list and who's on it besides you. Privacy is guaranteed.) Then, after each visit to the doctor, you will update your test status with your most recent results. If you test negative, the link you have between you and partners before this test will disappear. If you test positive, each of your partners between the time of your last test and this most recent one will be sent an anonymous notification that they are at risk for contracting an STD/STI, and that they should visit the doctor.
